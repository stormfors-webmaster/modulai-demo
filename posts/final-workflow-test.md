# Final Workflow Test

This post tests the complete workflow after fixing:

- ✅ Cache dependency path issue
- ✅ Option B file detection
- ✅ Improved logging

## Expected Results

When this is pushed to main:

1. Workflow should detect this file as changed
2. Cache should work without errors
3. Post should sync to Webflow CMS
4. Detailed logs should show the process

Let's verify everything works! 🎉
