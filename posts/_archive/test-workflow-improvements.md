# Testing Improved Workflow

This post tests the newly committed workflow improvements including:

- ✅ Option B: GitHub Actions context-based file detection
- ✅ Improved logging
- ✅ Better error handling

## Expected Behavior

When this post is pushed, the workflow should:

1. Detect this file as changed
2. Run the sync script with verbose logging
3. Create the post in Webflow CMS
4. Show detailed logs in GitHub Actions

Let's see if it works! 🚀
